# Books Recommendation System

#### Introduction

System that recommends books to a user. The books are in two dataset files, [books.csv](https://github.com/KevMCh/BookRecommendationSystem/blob/master/dataset/books.csv) and [ratingsBooks.csv](https://github.com/KevMCh/BookRecommendationSystem/blob/master/dataset/ratingsBooks.csv).

#### Used with a new dataset

It's simple, run the [PreprocessedData.R](https://github.com/KevMCh/BookRecommendationSystem/blob/master/PreprocessedData.R) with a changed dataset (same structure) and run the Shiny application with the created files.
